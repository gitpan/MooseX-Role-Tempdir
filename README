MooseX-Role-Tempdir

This is a very simple Moose role that provides an attribute 'tmpdir' and
creates a temporary directory (via File::Temp) to go along with it. One
temporary directory will be created for every object with this role, so keep
that in mind if you're going crazy with lots of objects or
creation/destruction.
